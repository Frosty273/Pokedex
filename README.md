# Pokedex App

The pokedex displays information about a given pokemon name inputted into the search box. It displays back information such as the Pokemon sprite, abilities, type and stats.

## API Note

The api as of 08/09/2020 doesn't currently contain any reference to the pokemon sprite from geneeration 8 onwards (Pokemon number 808 and onwards) so all placeholder sprite are left blank. This is a feature, not a bug.
